## Week 1: Foundations  

### Overview  
This week focuses on building a strong foundation in Python programming, Mathematics for AI, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

### Highlights  
- **Python Basics**: Variables, loops, functions, OOP, and libraries like NumPy and Pandas.  
- **Mathematics**: Linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics.  
- **DSA**: Arrays, linked lists, trees, and fundamental sorting/searching algorithms.  
- **Project**: ThinkBoard - A Python-based web application for data analysis and visualization.  

### Project: ThinkBoard  

A Python-powered web application designed to simplify data analysis and visualization. With features like CSV uploads, statistical computations, interactive charts, and calculus functions, ThinkBoard showcases the practical application of foundational concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.8+** installed ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code)
- Basic knowledge of terminal commands
- Internet access for dependencies

## Setup Guide

### Local Installation

1. Clone the repository.  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Journey.git
   cd thinkboard
   ```
2. Install dependencies.  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the server.  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Access the app in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.  

### Quick Start

- Upload a CSV file to explore its statistical metrics.
- Visualize data interactively with different chart types.
- Sort or search through data instantly.

---

## Usage

### Data Upload

- Click "Choose File" to upload your CSV.
- The application validates the file and displays metrics like mean, median, and mode.

### Visualization

- Select the chart type from the dropdown menu.
- Charts update dynamically based on user interaction.

### Sorting and Searching

- Use the sort functionality to order data by any column.
- Search for specific data using the query field.

### Calculus Features

- Compute numerical gradients for numeric columns and visualize results.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for advanced chart types (scatter, doughnut, etc.).
- Implement additional calculus features like numerical integration.
- Allow exporting sorted/search results as CSV.
- Deploy to cloud platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
- Integrate with databases for persistent storage.
