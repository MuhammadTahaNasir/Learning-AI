## Week 1: Foundations  

### Overview  
This week focuses on building a strong foundation in Python programming, Mathematics for AI, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

### Highlights  
- **Python Basics**: Variables, loops, functions, OOP, and libraries like NumPy and Pandas.  
- **Mathematics**: Linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics.  
- **DSA**: Arrays, linked lists, trees, and fundamental sorting/searching algorithms.  
- **Project**: ThinkBoard - A Python-based web application for data analysis and visualization.  

### Project: ThinkBoard  

A Python-powered web application designed to simplify data analysis and visualization. With features like CSV uploads, statistical computations, interactive charts, and calculus functions, ThinkBoard showcases the practical application of foundational concepts.  

**Tech Stack**: Python, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, HTML, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js  

**Setup Instructions**:  
1. Clone the repository.  
   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd thinkboard
   ```
2. Install dependencies.  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
